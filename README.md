# EUT Quantum Geometry in Biology

> Applying harmonic resonance and geometric coherence to biological systems.

This repository demonstrates how **EUT** principles extend into biology through  
**spatial transcriptomics**, **connectomics**, and **metabolic reprogramming**.

The EUT Quantum Geometry in Biology repository demonstrates how the Einstein Unified Theory (EUT) reframes living systems through harmonic resonance and geometric coherence. This module includes reproducible Python pipelines and manuscript scaffolding for:

- Spatial transcriptomics: harmonic stability in gene expression patterns
- Connectomics: resonance detection and stability indices in brain networks
- Metabolic reprogramming: coherence and canalization in cellular energy flow

Together, these demos extend EUT beyond physics and mathematics into biology, showing how resonance structures support stability and persistence in complex living systems. All releases are archived with permanent DOIs in the EUT-Lab Zenodo Community.
